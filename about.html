    <h1>Who is Derek?</h1>
		<h2>The Short Answer:</h2>
            <p>I am a student in the Computer Science major at AAST that loves technology, especially the programming, networking, electrical, and engineering side of it.</p>
        <h2>The Long Answer:</h2>
            <p>Pull up a chair and grab yourself a cup of joe. This is going to be a while.</p>
            <p>My name is Derek A. Herrera Diaz. I was born in Mexico in 2001. I moved to the United states at the age of five. Despite not knowing any English, I quickly adapted to the language and the lifestyle in South Carolina. In this country I noticed how different teaching was. Students were constantly exposed to technology. Looking back at my earlier school years, It is amazing just how much school funding went into technology. School became my favorite place in to be in. I found myself always in front of a screen, learning something new every day. Soon, I wanted to start making the content I was exposed to so much. In 4th grade I was introduced to coding (block coding that is). I stood up late at night making all sorts of animations, games, and interactive stories. I got an iPod as a present one birthday. It was the first non-video-game device I owned. With it I dwelled into Graphic Design. In middle school I played the Alto Saxophone and taught myself how to play my favorite tunes. I was always ready to learn something new. That's when something horrible happend in 7th grade.</p>
      		<p>Ok I am being a tad dramatic. But after 7th grade I went silent. I really didn't do anything that felt worthwhile. I tried again and again to persue creativity once again, but I couldn't. BUT, I am determined to make that change. I am working on tons of things in my free time and I am very excited to <a href="projects.html">tease and reveal them</a>. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.</p>
